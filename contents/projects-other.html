    <p class="description">
      An imperative hybrid stack-based programming language, the NorthernLion Programming Language (NLPL or NorthernLang) is inspired by the iconic cadence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northernlion">NorthernLion</a>. A turing complete, if quite cumbersome language, it is interpreted in Python, using <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html">PLY</a> for lexing and parsing.
