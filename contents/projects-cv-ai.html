      Launched during my semester abroad in Pohang, my team and I created a tool for identifying mistakes in workout form. We used a toolchain consisting of <a href="https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/ViTPose">ViTPose</a> and a slightly modified version of <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Duan_Revisiting_Skeleton-Based_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2022_paper.html">PoseConv3D</a>. We trained and tested our approach on the <a href="https://github.com/ParitoshParmar/Fitness-AQA">Fitness-AQA dataset</a>, where we improve the baseline accuracy by about 7%. As of July 2025, our approach is still the state of the art on Fitness-AQA.

      We use traditional (= no machine learning) computer vision pipelines to detect and digitize a Rubik's Cube configuration. Afterwards, we use the <a href="https://github.com/hkociemba/RubiksCube-TwophaseSolver">Twophase solver</a> to find a solution for the cube and provide detailed instructions via a 3D user interface. We were surprised at the accuracy and speed with which the rule-based CV pipeline is able complete this task.
